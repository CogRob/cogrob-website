title: Multi-Robot Optimization
summary: Many tasks in the real world require teams composed of multiple robots to work together. For example, in the security domain, multiple robots can continuously monitor a physical perimeter to detect intrusions. Solving multi-robot problems, however, introduces several key challenges, such as learning and acting in the presence of other actors who may introduce added complexity by altering their behaviors. This research area spans a large spectrum from traditional game-theoretic methods, to the application of multi-agent reinforcement learning, to develop solutions to multi-robot tasks such as multi-robot patrolling and pursuit-evasion.
