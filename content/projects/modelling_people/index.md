title: Modelling People
summary: Safety-critical systems often require human-in-the loop architecture due to the high consequences of error or failure. The performance of these systems, unlike the success of fully autonomous platforms, depends on not only machine capabilities but also the efficacy of human operators. We use surgical robotics platforms from across the autonomy spectrum - completely teleoperated to fully autonomous - to examine human operator performance through biometric analysis as well as autonomous platform capabilities through task environment perception and reasoning. We aim to develop generalizable methods to understand, predict, and enhance the success rates of human-in-the-loop robotic systems participating in safety-critical scenarios.
